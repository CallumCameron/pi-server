* Setup a CA
./00-make-ca <dir> <name>

* Create certificates
** For a server
cd <dir>
./scripts/make-pi-server-certs

** For an OpenVPN client
cd <dir>
./scripts/make-client-cert

* Revoke a certificate
cd <dir>
./scripts/revoke-cert <cert>

* Install certificates on the server
Copy all the files in the folder generated by make-pi-server-certs to /etc/pi-server/certs on the server, and make sure they are owned by root, with the correct permissions.

* Install certificates for users' browsers
The CA cert must be installed in order to access the Syncthing control panel. The main webpage provides a link to do this.
