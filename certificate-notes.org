Assuming the use of easy-rsa.

* Setup a CA
  1. Create the directory:
     make-cadir "${DIR}"
     cd "${DIR}"
  3. Edit vars based on the template
  2. Create the root CA certificate:
     . ./vars
     ./build-ca


* Create certificates
** For a server
   cd "${DIR}"
   . ./vars
   ./build-key-server "${SERVER_DOMAIN_OR_IP}"

** For a client
   Firefox, at least, needs certificates in PKCS12 format

   cd "${DIR}"
   . ./vars
   ./build-key-pkcs12 "${CLIENT_NAME}"


* Install certificates for users
  All users need to have the CA certificate installed in their browsers.

** Firefox
   Preferences -> advanced -> certificates -> view certificates

   The CA certificate goes in 'Authorities'
   The browser's own client certificate goes in 'Your certificates'

   Then do 'Import'
